Bugs to fix:
[x] Startup working directory
    [x] Find binary data (libgame.dll and rohin.dll)
    [x] Find Data directory (for models, textures, shaders, etc.)
    [x] Works when clicking 'game.exe' 
    [x] Works when run through 10x
    [x] Works when run through game.sln
    [x] Works when clicking 'game.exe' (from cmake)
    [x] Works when run through visual studio (from cmake)
    [x] -r flag still works

[x] Console output weirdness
    [x] Console prints normally in 10x
    [x] Console closes automatically in Visual Studio

[ ] Finish lighting in scene representation
    [x] directional light
    [x] point lights
    [x] spot lights
    [~] sky light
        [x] Split render_texture_2D into render_texture_ and resource_texture
        [x] create new texture types (texture_2D, texture_3D, texture_cube)
        [x] pull sky light code out of renderer.cpp, and make reusable
        [x] allow scene to set sky light
        [x] save pre-baked sky light maps to file
            [x] save mip-maps for cubemaps :)
        [x] load pre-baked sky light maps from file
            [x] why no load ;-; -> They load :)
        [x] add shader float that controls sky light contribution [0, 1]
        [ ] Speed up IBL_Bake writing/reading!
            [ ] combine output files? (cubemap faces/mip-mip levels?)
            [ ] hybrid load/compute?
    [~] Shadows
        [x] Implement shadow-mapping for the single directional light
        [x] Really basic (bad) PCF to make shadows smoother
        [x] Scene controls for shadow mapping params
        [ ] Look into methods for better soft shadows
            [ ] Variance Shadow Mapping (VSM: https://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10/direct3d/Source/VarianceShadowMapping/Doc/VarianceShadowMapping.pdf)
                Seems promising!

[ ] Animation
    [ ] Animation blending between anim_graph nodes

[ ] Scene 'editor' pane
    [ ] add rest of animation_controller info, and get rid of AnimGraph window
    [ ] !!! serialize scene to file !!!
    [ ] !!! load scene from file    !!!

[x] Assert pass
    [x] Use AssertMsg() for many cases that use Assert() right now
    [x] Create global max_log_level variable that disables messages

[x] Config file for basic runtime settings

[ ] rohin_dev parity features
    [ ] Scene swapping
        [ ] change config-file to support arrays
    [ ] Debug rendering (wireframe, lines, axes, etc.)
    [ ] Collision being used
    [ ] Text rendering
    [ ] 2D rendering (menus and such)
    [ ] Sound
    [ ] Entity scripting
    [ ] Input 'axes' and 'actions'
    [ ] Gamepad Input
